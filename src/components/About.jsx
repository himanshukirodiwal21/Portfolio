            <p>
              I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my
              Bachelor's in Technology from Rajasthan Technical University. With
              a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I
              love creating seamless digital experiences that solve real-world
              problems.
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey in tech began with a curiosity about how things work,
              which led me to explore various programming languages and
              frameworks. I've had the opportunity to work as an intern at
              OXmaint Inc, where I contributed to full-stack development
              projects and gained valuable experience in product enhancement and
              customer engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm particularly interested in modern web technologies, data
              structures and algorithms, and creating user-friendly interfaces.
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
              contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal
              projects that challenge my skills.
